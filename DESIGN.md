# Collectable Card Identifier

## Idea and Problem Statement

### Core Idea
To programmatically identify individual cards of various Trading Card Games (TCG) and Collectible Card Games (CCG), starting with "Pokemon" and expanding to "Magic: The Gathering" and "YuGiOh!". This system will be used for applications like inventory management, automated sorting, and card valuation. The focus of this project is the dataset generator, which is a critical component for training effective image classification models.

### Problem Statement
Create a dataset generator capable of producing a diverse and extensive training dataset for identifying tens of thousands of TCG/CCG cards. Since available images are limited to high-resolution, cropped versions of each card, the generator will apply various transformations (zoom, rotate, perspective skew, different backgrounds, etc.) to create a comprehensive training dataset.

### Primary Goal
Develop a dataset generator that can:
- Generate and manage datasets to train image classifiers for TCG/CCG cards.
- Perform a variety of image transformations to create a diverse dataset.
- Support the broader goal of building a card sorting robot that uses trained models for card identification.

## Requirements

### Must-Have Features
1. **Dataset Generation:**
   - Ability to generate and manage datasets to train the image classifier.
   - Create dataset images based on the original card image using a pipeline of transformations.

2. **Image Transformations:**
   - Perform and manage transformations on original card images (zoom, rotate, perspective skew, different backgrounds, etc.).

3. **Dataset Management:**
   - Basic management of multiple datasets to ensure effective training and testing.
   - Ensure separation between different card games.

### Nice-to-Have Features
1. **Dataset Selection:**
   - Full control over selecting specific cards and sets for the dataset, focusing on generating tournament-legal subsets.

2. **User Interface:**
   - A user-friendly interface for managing datasets.

3. **Statistical Reporting:**
   - Additional statistical reporting on dataset diversity and transformation effectiveness.

### User Roles
1. **Subject Matter Expert:** 
   - The primary user interacting with the application.

2. **Future Roles:** 
   - Developers or data scientists who could contribute to or utilize the datasets.

### Constraints and Limitations
1. **Development Speed:**
   - Single developer, which may limit the speed of development.

2. **Budget:**
   - Shoe-string budget, requiring careful resource management and prioritization of essential features.

### Platform Compatibility

#### Server Environment
1. **Flexibility:**
   - The application should remain flexible for various use cases, including desktop/personal-server use with a CLI, cloud environments, and integration with platforms like Apache Airflow.

2. **Containerization:**
   - Use of Dockerfiles to ensure the application can be easily deployed across different environments, from local development to cloud deployment.

3. **Extensibility:**
   - Design the system to be compatible with commonly used technologies and frameworks to facilitate integration and extension for future needs.

#### Technology Compatibility
1. **Programming Language:**
   - Python as the primary language for development, leveraging its extensive libraries for image processing and data manipulation.

2. **Data Management:**
   - Local filesystem for initial data storage, with the capability to expand to cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3.

3. **Automation and Workflow Integration:**
   - Ensure compatibility with automation platforms like Apache Airflow for orchestrating complex workflows and managing large-scale data processing tasks.

4. **Deployment and CI/CD:**
   - Use Docker for containerization and tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring smooth and repeatable deployments.

### Future Considerations
- **Card Sorting Robot:**
  - The dataset generated by this project will be used to train models for a card sorting robot that can accurately identify and sort individual TCG/CCG cards.
- **Additional Applications:**
  - The trained models can be utilized for other applications, such as inventory management, automated sorting, and card valuation.
