# Collectable Card Identifier

## Description

The Collectable Card Identifier project focuses on generating and managing datasets to train image classifiers for identifying individual cards from various Trading Card Games (TCG) and Collectible Card Games (CCG). Starting with "Pokemon" and expanding to "Magic: The Gathering" and "YuGiOh!", this system can be used for applications like inventory management, automated sorting, and card valuation.

The primary goal is to create a dataset generator that produces a diverse and extensive training dataset through various image transformations. This dataset will support the broader objective of developing a card sorting robot and other related applications.
